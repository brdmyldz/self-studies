Note: a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order 
to be effective! a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to 
be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.

The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. 
This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
