        The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
        The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. 
        It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.
    -->
    <!--
        In the following example we have two <span> elements with a class attribute with the value of "note". 
        Both <span> elements will be styled equally according to the .note style definition in the head section.
