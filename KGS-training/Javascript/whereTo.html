        You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
        Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

        Scripts in <head>:

        Scripts to be executed when they are called, or when an event is triggered, are placed in functions.

        Put your functions in the head section, this way they are all in one place, 
        and they do not interfere with page content.


        Scripts in <body>:

        If your is not placed inside a function, or if your script writes page content, 
        it should be placed in the body section. It is a good idea to place scripts at the bottom of the <body> element.
        This can improve page load, because script compilation can slow down the display.

    <!-- EXTERNAL JAVASCRIPT-->

    <!-- You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like. -->
    <script src="myScript.js"></script>

    <!--
        Advantages:
            It separates HTML and code
            It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
            Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
    -->

    <!-- An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways -->

    <!-- With a full URL (a full web address) -->
    <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>

    <!-- With a file path (like /js/) -->
    <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>
            
    <!-- Without any path -->
    <script src="myScript.js"></script>
